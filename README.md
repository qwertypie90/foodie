Iris - Project 1 - Web App


This website is made for students who are taking "The Coding Bootcamp" at UCLA Extension. 
Students can simply sign in and create an article for publication and share quick tips or tutorials about class topics, assignment, homework, etc. 
This is a great source bank students can always go back for a reference and tutorial. 


## Getting Started

Anyone can browse the articles on the main site. You must have a gMail account in order to submit articles.

### Prerequisites/Tips

Our 'submit article' functionality reads markdown format. So if you wanted your article to have cool styling or if you wanted to submit code blocks like this:

```
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="asset/css/style.css">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat" rel="stylesheet">
    <!-- Moment -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.12.0/moment.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

knoweledge of this language/format is necessary. We recommend [this site ](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get started.

It's EASY! **We promise.**
